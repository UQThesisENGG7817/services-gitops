## githubConfigUrl is the GitHub url for where you want to configure runners
## ex: https://github.com/myorg/myrepo or https://github.com/myorg
githubConfigUrl: "https://github.com/UQThesisENGG7817"

## If you have a pre-define Kubernetes secret in the same namespace the gha-runner-scale-set is going to deploy,
## you can also reference it via `githubConfigSecret: pre-defined-secret`.
## You need to make sure your predefined secret has all the required secret data set properly.
##   For a pre-defined secret using GitHub PAT, the secret needs to be created like this:
##   > kubectl create secret generic pre-defined-secret --namespace=my_namespace --from-literal=github_token='ghp_your_pat'
##   For a pre-defined secret using GitHub App, the secret needs to be created like this:
##   > kubectl create secret generic pre-defined-secret --namespace=my_namespace --from-literal=github_app_id=123456 --from-literal=github_app_installation_id=654321 --from-literal=github_app_private_key='-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----*******'

## Optional controller service account that needs to have required Role and RoleBinding
## to operate this gha-runner-scale-set installation.
## The helm chart will try to find the controller deployment and its service account at installation time.
## In case the helm chart can't find the right service account, you can explicitly pass in the following value
## to help it finish RoleBinding with the right service account.
## Note: if your controller is installed to only watch a single namespace, you have to pass these values explicitly.
controllerServiceAccount:
  namespace: gha-runner
  name: gha-runner-controller
